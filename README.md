 ```
 docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG> .
 ```
 - Test the container locally
 ```
 docker run -p 8000:8000 <IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG>
 ```
 - Push to DockerHub replacing <DOCKERHUB_USERNAME> and <REPO_NAME> with the dockerhub username and the repository name
 ```
 docker push <DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>:<REPO_NAME>
 ```
 - Sign up on [Render Cloud](https://render.com)
 - Create a Web Service on Render and choose to deploy via dockers
 - Specify the url of the dockerhub repository and start build
- Use the URL provided by render after successful deployment of application after few minutes :)
